# MIDIpulate
A collection of tools to create and manipulate MIDI files

**binaural_beats_generator.py**  
Create binaural beats of a given length and a given frequency. I always pan the output file a bit more to the other speaker channel, to have a more centered tone. This script is a fork of https://github.com/noahspott/binaural-beats-generator.

**random_midi.py**  
Create a random midi file of a given length.

**tidal_wave.py**  
Fetch the tidal forecast from the German North Sea Shore and sonificate the data.
